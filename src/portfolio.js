      projectName: "Aid Across Borders: Analyzing U.S. Defense Aid and Military Support",
      skills: "Tableau, Python, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Geopolitical Strategies",
      projectDesc: "Explored how the U.S. channels defense funds to provide aid across regions, focusing on the Middle East. Analyzed trends in Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and grants, revealing key geopolitical strategies and military equipment distributions. Insights into U.S. defense aid highlighted how tailored military support aligns with regional needs, driving foreign policy and security strategies."
    },
    {
      projectName: "Enhancing Influencer Marketing on Twitter",
      skills: "Python, Data Mining, Social Media Analytics, Machine Learning",
      projectDesc: "Developed a new metric, Information Spreadability (IS), to assess true influence beyond follower count. Analyzed Twitter tech influencers by IS, showing that influencers with high engagement significantly outperform those chosen by follower count alone. The project highlighted the importance of genuine engagement in influencer marketing strategies, helping tech companies better target their campaigns and maximize outreach."
    },
    {
      projectName: "Assortment Planning in Fashion Retail",
      skills: "Python, Heuristics, Data Modelling, Operations Research",
      projectDesc: "Developed an optimization model for assortment planning in fashion retail, addressing demand estimation, product mix selection, and cost constraints. Implemented a two-phase heuristic solution, achieving a less than 1% gap from the upper bound across 240 datasets. Applied the model to a real-world retailer, optimizing product assortment for a women's dress catalog, leading to more informed inventory and budget decisions."
    },
    {
      projectName: "Optimizing Product Placement in Retail with Data Mining",
      skills: "Machine Learning, Algorithms, Python",
      projectDesc: "Developed a product assignment model using association rule mining to enhance cross-selling in retail environments. Implemented the nearest neighbor method for optimal product placement, resulting in a 37% increase in sales potential. Iteratively updated the model based on real-time sales data, achieving an additional 18% boost in cross-selling opportunities. This project highlights the value of data-driven retail strategies for maximizing sales."

    {
      projectName: "Remote Work Impact on Productivity & Work-Life Balance",
      skills: "R, Statistical Modelling, Data Analysis, Survey Research",
      projectDesc: "Conducted empirical research on remote work's effect on employee productivity and work-life balance in the tech industry. Utilized survey data and performed polynomial regression to explore non-linear relationships between remote work hours and key outcomes. Results indicated that moderate levels of remote work optimized productivity and work-life balance, while excessive remote work led to diminishing returns. The findings contribute to shaping flexible, employee-friendly remote work policies."

      projectName: "Product Assignment Optimization in Warehouse",
      skills: "Genetic Algorithm (GA), Linear Programming (LP), Gurobi, Data Modelling, Optimization",
      projectDesc: "Optimized warehouse layout by strategically assigning products to minimize handling time and improve storage efficiency. Integrated GA for diverse initial layouts, refined using LP for global optimality under operational constraints. Analyzed historical product-picking data to reduce travel distance and enhance productivity. The solution demonstrated significant reductions in operational costs and improved inventory management, paving the way for further research in dynamic warehouse optimization with real-time data."
